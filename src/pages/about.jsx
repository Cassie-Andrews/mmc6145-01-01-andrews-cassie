            <p className={styles.about}>I'm Cassie and I'm currently living in Bradenton, FL. I work as a program assistant at a local arts-based non-profit. I earned my undergraduate degree from Florida State University in book arts and printmaking and I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s Degree in Web Design & Online Communications at the University of Florida. My background in fine arts has equipped me with a unique perspective as I navigate the ever-evolving realm of digital design.
            
            Digital design enables me to create engaging, interactive experiences that parallel the traditional artforms I love like artist books. I am eager to explore balancing art and technology to connect with people in authentic new ways.</p>
